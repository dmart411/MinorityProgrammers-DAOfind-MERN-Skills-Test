              Decentralized Autonomous Organization
            </a>
            <div className="description">
              A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), sometimes called a
              decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC), is an organization
              represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is
              transparent, controlled by the organization members and not
              influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction
              record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain. The
              precise legal status of this type of business organization is
              unclear.

              Top Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Projects To Watch
            </a>
            <div className="description">
              The blockchain platform introduced the tool “decentralized
              autonomous organizations (DAOs)” with the objective to support the
              decentralized business ecosystem. They play an important part in
              decentralized finance. They could play a more significant role as
              DAO infrastructure becomes more proficient, and once-overlooked
              stakeholders in finance follow up on bigger governance
              requirements. A DAO is a blockchain technology-fueled association
              that depends on smart contracts to support itself. Despite the
              fact that there might be some degree of human intercession, the
              objective of a DAO is to be really decentralized in its
              activities. DAOs are new, yet they can possibly affect the DeFi
              space as well as organizations in a wide range of different fields
              and enterprises.

              A DAO is a commitment to share value with a community. DAOs seek
              to: Provide members with a voice through governance. Flatten
              hierarchy and create fluid workstreams. Allocate resources to
              achieve a core mission.
